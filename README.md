Implementation of this paper "Revisiting Local Descriptors via Frequent Pattern Mining for Fine-Grained Image Retrieval" 


Abstract: Fine-grained image retrieval aims at searching relevant images among fine-grained classes
given a query. The main difficulty of this task derives from the small interclass distinction and the
large intraclass variance of fine-grained images, posing severe challenges to the methods that only
resort to global or local features. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained image retrieval
method, where global–local aware feature representation is learned. Specifically, the global feature
is extracted by selecting the most relevant deep descriptors. Meanwhile, we explore the intrinsic
relationship of different parts via the frequent pattern mining, thus obtaining the representative
local feature. Further, an aggregation feature that learns global–local aware feature representation is
designed. Consequently, the discriminative ability among different fine-grained classes is enhanced.
We evaluate the proposed method on five popular fine-grained datasets. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that the performance of fine-grained image retrieval is improved with the
proposed global–local aware representation.
